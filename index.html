							<h2>Without agreed standards, innovation will grind to a halt in litigation courts.</h2>
							<p>
Laws govern the conduct of humans, and sometimes the machines that humans use, such as cars. But what happens when those cars become human-like, as in artificial intelligence that can drive cars? Who is responsible for any laws that are violated by the AI?

<br><br>An AI by design is artificial, and thus ideas such as liability or a jury of peers appears meaningless. The law will need to adapt through governance in application, to avoid an unlikely future, where AI is held responsible for its own actions.
</p>
<p>This consortium aims to work with government policy makers to ensure accordance with all applicable domestic and international law and to provide the greatest possible transparency.</p>

							<h2>Our Solution</h2>
							<h3><i>"A dog isn’t held liable for biting."</i></h3>
							<p>We don’t regulate non-human behavior. After considering the ability of the court system, and the impact of AI in today’s society, the world will need to adopt a standard for AI where the manufacturers and developers agree to abide by general ethical guidelines, transparency, and technical standards mandated by AI experts, and government regulators. This ensures that manufacturers and developers are liable when it is foreseeable that the algorithms and data can cause harm.
<br>
</p>
<p> Requirements include holding developers and corporations to a standard that requires clarity on liability for harm resulting from the use of artificial intelligence. <br>AI Consortium also uses machine-learning techniques to spot similarities in other AI applications formerly approved, as a way to provide reference for new submissions.
<br><br><strong>This consortium ensures that only AI models trained properly and working as expected would make it into the market.</strong>

							<h2>Who watches the watchers?</h2>
							<p>This consortium works with government, academic and industry professionals to serve as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>An ombudsman for supporting citizen challenges to organizations using machine learning.</li>
								<li>Ethical review boards capable of assessing the potential harms and benefits to society of particular applications and combinations of artificial intelligence.</li>
							
							</ul>

<p>The mission is to ask and answer whether the application achieves the end it sets out to, and that this end is desirable.</p>

							<h2>Tenets of Clean Insights</h2>
							<p>AI systems are starting to have transformational impacts on everyday life: from driverless cars, to bank apps that let us deposit checks with a picture, to informed decision making tools that tailors products for sales, and advertising. Such breakthroughs raise a host of questions for society, including ethical issues about the transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy, safety, and overall governance. </p>
							
							<h3>At minimum, to ensure standards, you must:</h3>
							<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Correctly identify any harmful impacts of artificial intelligence. </li>
								<li>Appropriate means of redress.</li>
								<li>Clearly define accountability measures.</li>
								<li>Clearly provide substantial benefits for society offered by this artificial intelligence application.</li>
							</ul>

The consortium is flexible, able to adapt to new uses and more advanced forms of artificial intelligence.

							<h2>Simplicity in Process</h2>
							<p>The simplicity of our process promotes innovation in this field of Artificial Intelligence, 
							and also provides an avenue for collaborative research, knowledge sharing, and governance.<br>Providing a mobile friendly approach to governance, subdues the bureaucracy many fear when articulating governance.</p>
