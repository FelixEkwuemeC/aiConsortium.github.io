Openly connecting principles for governing the development and application of AI, and fostering public debate.</p>

<div class="hide">
<p><span class="hide-inline">The AI Governance Consortium aims to work with AI Experts, government regulators  and partner organizations such as <strong><i><a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/" target="0">Partnership on AI</a></i></strong>, and <strong><i><a href="https://artificialintelligencenow.com/" target="0"> AI Now Initiative</a></i></strong> , to openly connect principles for governing the development and application of AI, grant approval to AI applications, and to foster public debate. 

The role of AIGC is to serve as an oversight body to grant approval to AI applications, for the protection of inventors, the future of innovation and the safety and interest of the public. AIGC also advises and assists innovators to navigate local and international laws required for AI development, as governments enact policies to govern AI. 

As a mobile tool, AIGC provides an AI-Powered search tool used to compare new AI applications with existing compliant AI products. 

By providing a mobile friendly approach to governance, AIGC subdues the bureaucracy many fear when articulating governance.

							<h2>Without agreed standards, innovation will grind to a halt in litigation courts.</h2>
							<p>
Laws govern the conduct of humans, and sometimes the machines that humans use, such as cars. But what happens when those cars become human-like, as in artificial intelligence that can drive cars? Who is responsible for any laws that are violated by the AI?

<br><br>An AI by design is artificial, and thus ideas such as liability or a jury of peers appears meaningless. The law will need to adapt through governance in application, to avoid an unlikely future, where AI is held responsible for its own actions.
</p>
<p>This consortium aims to work with government policy makers and the American Civil Liberties Union to ensure accordance with all applicable domestic and international law and to provide the greatest possible transparency to the public.</p>

							<h2>Our Solution</h2>
							<h3><i>"A dog isn’t held liable for biting."</i></h3>
							<p>We don’t regulate non-human behavior. After considering the ability of the court system, and the impact of AI in today’s society, the world will need to adopt a standard for AI where the manufacturers and developers agree to abide by general ethical guidelines, transparency, and technical standards mandated by AI experts, and government regulators. This ensures that manufacturers and developers are liable when it is foreseeable that the algorithms and data can cause harm.
<br>
</p>
<p> Requirements include holding developers and corporations to a standard that requires clarity on liability for harm resulting from the use of artificial intelligence. <br>AI Consortium also uses machine-learning techniques to spot similarities in other AI applications formerly approved, as a way to provide reference for new submissions.
</p>

<h3>At minimum, to ensure standards, you must:</h3>
							<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Correctly identify any harmful impacts of your artificial intelligence application. </li>
								<li>Appropriate means of redress.</li>
								<li>Clearly define accountability measures.</li>
								<li>Clearly provide substantial benefits for society offered by this artificial intelligence application.</li>

							<h2>Who watches the watchers?</h2>
							<p>This consortium works with government regulators, partners, academic and industry professionals to serve as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>An ombudsman for supporting citizen challenges to organizations using machine learning.</li>
								<li>Ethical review boards capable of assessing the potential harms and benefits to society of particular applications and combinations of artificial intelligence.</li>
							
							</ul>

<p>The mission is to ask and answer whether the application achieves the end it sets out to, and that this end is desirable.</p>

							<h2>Transparency in Innovation</h2>
							
							<p>AI systems are starting to have transformational impacts on everyday life: from driverless cars, to bank apps that let us deposit checks with a picture, to informed decision making tools that tailors products for sales, and advertising. Such breakthroughs raise a host of questions for society, including ethical issues about the transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy, safety, and overall governance.
		
		<br><br>By ensuring transparency, we provide avenue for public debate on applications of AI, an important factor in governance. 
		The consortium is understanding of privacy issues, and is able to adapt to new uses and more advanced forms of artificial intelligence.
<br><br><strong>This consortium ensures that only AI models trained properly and working as expected would make it into the market.</strong>

							<h2>Simplicity in Process</h2>
							<p>The simplicity of our process promotes innovation in this field of Artificial Intelligence, 
							and also provides an avenue for collaborative research into public issues, knowledge sharing, and governance.<br>We propose the 
							existence of many more organizations focused on AI governance, and public debate, and we intend to create partnerships for a broader reach, 
							impact, and thorough review and approval process of AI applications.</p>
							
							<p>The consortium is flexible, able to adapt to new and more advanced forms of artificial intelligence applications.</p>
